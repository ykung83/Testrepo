I have never really used git before. I tried to use it over the summer just for code practice but I had no idea what I was doing so I gave up. It's cool that we are learning how to use it in this class though. I think git is a really great tool and it used in the professional world too so it's great to already know if if you're planning on going into a job soon. So far git doesn't seem that hard. I think the commands are very straight forward and simple. Although, I do think that I don't really have enough experience to really know the diffucult commands of git, but for now it's not bad at all. I do really like git. It's honestly way easier to get files from git than using win scp like i usually do, so maybe I could even consider using get to store my files instead. But overall, I think git is really great and I'm glad that we got to take the time in the class to get to use it and learn a bit about it.
