(base) Yung-Chis-MacBook-Air:Testrepo Games$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

yk7298/yk_noadd.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)



This means that the only file in my local repository that is different from 
the remote repository is the file 'yk_noadd.txt' in the 'yk7298' directory. 
This means that even though I can see the file on my local machine, the 
other people who have access to the repository cannot see it. In addition,
it means I have not added and commited it yet which means even if I used
git push the file 'yk_noadd.txt' would not show up in the remote repository. 
If I had used git add on the file, git status would also show that there are
modifications that have not been commited and pushed.
