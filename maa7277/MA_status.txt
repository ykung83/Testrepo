On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        maa7277/MA_noadd.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

The above output means that my branch has all of the most recent files from the remote repository ("Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'"). The output also lets me know that I have one untracked file that I have not added to the staging area. That file is listed as maa7277/MA_noadd.txt. The output finally says that the staging area is empty ("nothing added to commit").
