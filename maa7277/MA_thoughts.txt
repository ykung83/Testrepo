I had not used git before this year. However, prior to our lecture on Thursday, I used git with a group of friends to work on a project for a hackathon. Thankfully, one of my friends had used git before and walked me through how to set up an account, use git commands to add and pull files, and work on a project simultaneously. I enjoyed using git for the project and I was able to figure out the basics pretty quickly.

That being said, I still was only introduced to the basics because we were on a time crunch. So, it was nice to listen to the lecture and learn more about the differences between the local and remote repositories, as well as new commands I didn't know about to make using git easier. I hope to continue to improve at using git so that I can use it for even more projects in the future.
